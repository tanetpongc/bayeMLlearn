## Read me

This repository is a collection of R markdown producing supplementary documents for assignments in ["Bayesian Learning"](https://github.com/mattiasvillani/BayesLearnCourse) course (2020) and ["Machine Learning"](https://github.com/mattiasvillani/MLcourse) course (2021) by [Mattias Villani](https://mattiasvillani.com/), Professor of Statistics at Stockholm University. All works have been done with my PhD colleague at Stockholm School of Economics, [Huong Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lanhuongnguyen276/). 

The main purpose of this repository is to show, besides [my PhD projects in retail/marketing analytics](https://github.com/tanetpongc), my fundamental knowledge in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. These documents (or R markdown) cover following topics: 1) exploring posterior distributions in one-parameter models by simulation and direct numerical evaluation, 2) polynomial regression and classification with logistic regression, 3) Gibbs sampling, Metropolis-Hastings and Stan, 4) regularized nonlinear regression and classification, 5) regularized regression, and 6) regularized classification

## Description for documents

In **/src** directory, you will find following file
1) BayeML_Rmarkdown_1.Rmd: Supplementary document for [exercise](https://github.com/mattiasvillani/BayesLearnCourse/raw/master/Labs/Lab1/Lab1.pdf) regarding exploring posterior distributions in one-parameter models by simulation and direct numerical evaluation.
2) BayeML_Rmarkdown_2.Rmd: Supplementary document for [exercise](https://github.com/mattiasvillani/BayesLearnCourse/raw/master/Labs/Lab2/Lab2.pdf) regarding polynomial regression and classification with logistic regression.
3) BayeML_Rmarkdown_3.Rmd: Supplementary document for [exercise](https://github.com/mattiasvillani/BayesLearnCourse/raw/master/Labs/Lab3/Lab3.pdf) regarding Gibbs sampling, Metropolis-Hastings and Stan. As we implemented `Stan-code` in addition to existing R code in question 3, `BayeML_Rmarkdown_3_3b.stan`,`BayeML_Rmarkdown_3_3b.stan` and `BayeML_Rmarkdown_3_3b.stan` are needed to run extra analysis using `Stan`.
4) BayeML_Rmarkdown_4.Rmd: Supplementary document for [exercise](https://github.com/mattiasvillani/MLcourse/blob/main/Labs/Lab1a.pdf) regarding regularized regression.
5) BayeML_Rmarkdown_5.Rmd: Supplementary document for [exercise](https://github.com/mattiasvillani/MLcourse/blob/main/Labs/Lab1b.pdf) regarding regularized classification.
6) BayeML_Rmarkdown_6.Rmd: Supplementary document for [exercise](https://github.com/mattiasvillani/MLcourse/blob/main/Labs/Lab2.pdf) regarding deep learning and Gaussian Processes.
7) BayeML_Rmarkdown_7.Rmd: Supplementary document for [exercise](https://github.com/mattiasvillani/MLcourse/blob/main/Labs/Lab3.pdf) regarding unsupervised, semisupervised and active learning.
